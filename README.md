## Repo to test out github actions

### Pull request action

Uses [pull-request-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pull-request-action) by [repo-sync](https://github.com/repo-sync)

Whenever there is a push on dev branch it will automatically create a PR from the dev branch to the master branch.
